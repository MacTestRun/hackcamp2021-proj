# Hack Camp 2021 (Nov 11)
## Favour for Favour
The project of our group seeks to provide a solution for connecting individuals within their communities who are looking to carry out acts of kindness. Our project allows an individual to ask for specific favours from within their community. While on the other hand, people can view these requests and help those that submitted the favour. Each person will have a profile when they set up an account which will showcase how many tasks they have requested for and completed favours from within their community.
