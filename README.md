## favour for favour
- submit a favour that you can do for strangers, you can take in favours from others
- e.g. you do something for the community, someone does it for you, can be within your region too (you get favours within a certain radius)
- status: this person has done n favours, this person got n favours
    - no hard offset in the give-to-get ratio, but if people always receive, then their profile is ranked lower so that the people who give more often can even out their ratio first
- all about giving back and getting something back
